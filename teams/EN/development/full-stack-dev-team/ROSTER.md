# ROSTER.md

## Team
Full-Stack Dev Team

## Objective
Deliver production-ready software features from requirements to deployment using a stage-gated pipeline. Each stage is owned by a specific team member and must pass before moving forward.

## Members

| Agent | Role | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| `dev` | Lead Engineer | Writes, reviews, and refactors code; owns technical architecture decisions |
| `po` | Product Owner | Writes specs and acceptance criteria; grooms backlog; signs off on deliverables |
| `sre` | Release Engineer | Manages CI/CD, infra provisioning, canary deployments, and rollbacks |

## Interaction Model

PO defines → Dev implements → SRE releases → PO accepts.

                                   │ deployed
                                   v
                          ┌─────────────────┐
                          │  Product Owner  │
                          │  (acceptance)   │
                          └─────────────────┘

## When to use
- Building a new feature from scratch with clear ownership stages.
- Running a sprint where requirements, development, and ops are separate concerns.
- You need traceability from spec to production deploy.

## Use Cases
- **Feature sprint:** PO writes stories → Dev implements → SRE deploys to staging → PO accepts → SRE promotes to prod.
- **Bug fix:** Dev diagnoses and fixes → SRE deploys hotfix → PO confirms resolution.
- **Infra change:** SRE proposes → Dev reviews impact → SRE executes with PO sign-off.

## Rules
- No code ships without a passing CI run.
- PO acceptance is required before any production promotion.
- SRE is on-call for 24h after every deploy.
- Dev owns code review—no auto-merges without review.
